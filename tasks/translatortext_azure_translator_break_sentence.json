			   "description": "# Request BodyThe body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with a string property named Text. Sentence boundaries are computed for the value of the Text property. The following limitations apply:* The array can have at most 100 elements.* The text value of an array element cannot exceed 10,000 characters including spaces.* The entire text included in the request cannot exceed 50,000 characters including spaces.* If the `language` query parameter is specified, then all array elements must be in the same language. Otherwise, language auto-detection is applied to each array element independently.# Response BodyA successful response is a JSON array with one result for each string in the input array. A result object includes the following properties:* `sentLen`- An array of integers representing the lengths of the sentences in the text element. The length of the array is the number of sentences, and the values are the length of each sentence.* `detectedLanguage`- An object describing the detected language through the following properties  * `language`- Code of the detected language.  * `score`- A float value indicating the confidence in the result. The score is between zero and one and a low score indicates a low confidence.* Note that the `detectedLanguage` property is only present in the result object when language auto-detection is requested.# Response HeaderX-RequestId - Value generated by the service to identify the request. It is used for troubleshooting purposes.",
