	"description": "Add a face to a specified large face list, up to 1,000,000 faces. To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [LargeFaceList Face - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c8ad2de3616c086f2d4) or [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called. Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236).* Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.* JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.* 'targetFace' rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided 'targetFace' rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), thereâ€™s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.* Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.* Adding/deleting faces to/from a same face list are processed sequentially and to/from different face lists are in parallel.* The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.* Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided.
